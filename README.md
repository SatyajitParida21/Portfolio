Personal Portfolio Website Created by Satyajit  This is a responsive personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website showcases my skills, projects, and professional journey in an engaging and user-friendly manner.

The primary goal of this project was to create a visually appealing and fully responsive portfolio that highlights my skills, achievements, and projects. The website serves as a professional portfolio for potential employers, collaborators, or clients to understand my capabilities and get in touch with me effortlessly.

Additionally, this project allowed me to refine my front-end development skills, implement modern web design principles, and explore responsive layouts and interactivity.
