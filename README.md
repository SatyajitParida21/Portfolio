Personal Portfolio Website Created by Satyajit  This is a responsive personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website showcases my skills, projects, and professional journey in an engaging and user-friendly manner.

The website serves as a professional portfolio for potential employers, collaborators, or clients to understand my capabilities and get in touch with me effortlessly.
